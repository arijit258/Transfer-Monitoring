### Fault Diagnosis

**Primary Fault Type:** Active Partial Discharge in HV Winding

**Analysis:** The high acetylene concentration (35 ppm) is definitive evidence of electrical discharge activity within the transformer. Acetylene is only generated by high-energy electrical arcing or discharge. Combined with elevated hydrogen, this indicates active partial discharge causing progressive insulation damage.

**Partial Discharge Measurements:**
- PD Magnitude: >500 pC (detected via acoustic emission)
- Location: HV winding, phase B area
- Pattern: Consistent with void discharge in solid insulation

**Root Cause Assessment:**
1. Void formation in winding insulation (aging)
2. Possible delamination of pressboard
3. Moisture migration reducing dielectric strength
4. 20-year age contributing to insulation degradation

### Risk Factors

| Risk | Severity | Probability |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Active partial discharge | Critical | Confirmed |
| High acetylene (C₂H₂) | Critical | Active |
| Winding insulation damage | Critical | Progressive |
| Internal flashover | Severe | High risk |
| Explosion/fire | Severe | Possible |

---

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **CRITICAL:** Schedule immediate outage - DO NOT delay
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Reduce load to minimum operational level
3. **Within 48 hours:** Complete transformer isolation
4. **Required:** Internal inspection and PD source location
5. **Prepare:** Contingency for unit replacement

---

### Repair/Replacement Assessment

Given the age (20 years) and severity of the partial discharge activity:

| Option | Estimated Cost | Timeframe | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Rewinding | High | 3-6 months | Consider |
| Replacement | Very High | 6-12 months | Evaluate |
| Repair + Risk | Medium | 1-2 months | Not Recommended |

**Assessment:** Due to the transformer's age and the severity of PD activity, replacement planning should begin immediately while repair options are evaluated.

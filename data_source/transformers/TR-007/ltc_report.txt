               LTC DEGRADATION REPORT - TR-007
               Eta Transmission Autotransformer  
               Rating: 200 MVA | Voltage: 400/220/33 kV
===============================================================================

STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING - LTC Degradation + Oil Contamination
HEALTH INDEX: 58%
PRIMARY ISSUE: Load Tap Changer Contact Wear

===============================================================================
                    LTC SUMMARY
===============================================================================

LTC Type: On-Load Tap Changer (Resistor Type)
Manufacturer: MR (Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen)
Model: OILTAP M
Installation: 2008
Total Operations: 275,000 (High duty)
Operations/Year: ~16,000

CONTACT CONDITION:
- Contact wear: 65% of allowable
- Contact resistance: Elevated (12% above baseline)
- Arcing contact condition: Degraded
- Selector switch: Satisfactory

===============================================================================
                    OIL CONTAMINATION ANALYSIS
===============================================================================

The LTC compartment oil shows significant contamination from switching arcs:

PARAMETER         | VALUE    | LIMIT    | STATUS
------------------|----------|----------|--------
Carbon particles  | HIGH     | LOW      | ⚠️ Contaminated
BDV (LTC oil)    | 28 kV    | >40 kV   | ⚠️ Low
Acetylene        | 12 ppm   | <2 ppm   | ⚠️ From arcing
Color            | 6.0      | <3.0     | ⚠️ Darkened

MAIN TANK OIL IMPACT:
- Cross-contamination detected via selector
- Main tank BDV: 32 kV (reduced from 45 kV)
- Carbon particles migrating to main tank
- Increasing tan delta in main tank oil

===============================================================================
                    DGA INTERPRETATION
===============================================================================

The DGA shows characteristic LTC-related gas generation:

1. ACETYLENE (C2H2): 12 ppm
   - Source: LTC switching arcs
   - Normal for high-duty LTC
   - Requires monitoring

2. HYDROGEN (H2): 320 ppm
   - Elevated from LTC arcing
   - Also indicates main tank stress

3. ETHYLENE (C2H4): 195 ppm
   - High temperature indicator
   - Contact heating during operations

KEY RATIO (Rogers):
- C2H2/C2H4 = 0.06 → LTC arcing signature
- Consistent with tap changer degradation

                   MAINTENANCE HISTORY
===============================================================================

DATE       | ACTION                    | RESULT
-----------|---------------------------|------------------
2012-04    | LTC overhaul             | Contacts replaced
2016-08    | LTC inspection           | 40% wear noted
2020-03    | Oil change (LTC)         | Temporary improvement
2023-06    | Contact inspection       | 60% wear, monitoring
2024-11    | Emergency oil filter     | Partial improvement

OVERDUE MAINTENANCE:
⚠️ LTC overhaul recommended at 250,000 operations
⚠️ Current operations: 275,000 (25,000 overdue)

===============================================================================
                    RISK ASSESSMENT
===============================================================================

CURRENT RISKS:
1. Contact failure during operation → Outage
2. Oil flashover in LTC compartment → Fire risk
3. Cross-contamination → Main insulation damage
4. Mechanical failure → Stuck tap position

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:
- LTC failure (12 months): 25%
- Oil-related incident: 15%
- Combined failure mode: 35%

===============================================================================
                  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
===============================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Within 14 days):
1. ⚠️ Schedule LTC maintenance outage
2. ⚠️ Perform oil filtration (both compartments)
3. ⚠️ Contact resistance measurement
4. ⚠️ Dynamic resistance measurement

DURING OUTAGE:
1. Complete LTC overhaul
2. Replace arcing contacts
3. Inspect selector mechanism
4. Oil change (LTC compartment)
5. Main tank oil treatment

POST-MAINTENANCE:
1. Baseline DGA after 100 operations
2. Contact resistance trending
3. Consider load redistribution to reduce operations

                    COST ESTIMATE
===============================================================================

Item                          | Cost (USD)
------------------------------|------------
LTC overhaul (contacts)       | $150,000
Oil treatment (both tanks)    | $45,000
Dynamic resistance testing    | $12,000
Outage cost (48 hours)        | $85,000
------------------------------|------------
TOTAL                         | $292,000

vs. Failure Cost: $2M - $5M (unplanned)

===============================================================================
                     CONCLUSION
===============================================================================

LTC maintenance is overdue and should be scheduled within 14 days. The 
combination of contact wear and oil contamination creates elevated risk.
Load redistribution should be considered to reduce operation frequency.

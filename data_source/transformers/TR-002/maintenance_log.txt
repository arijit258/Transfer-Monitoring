===============================================================================
                      CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS
===============================================================================
1. Schedule comprehensive oil treatment within 30 days
2. Perform Degree of Polymerization (DP) analysis
3. Consider load reduction during high ambient temperature
4. Evaluate replacement timeline (5-7 years)
5. Increase DGA sampling frequency to monthly

===============================================================================
                        RISK FACTORS
===============================================================================
- High moisture content accelerating paper aging
- Elevated tan delta indicating insulation deterioration  
- Paper DP estimated below 500 (aging threshold)
- High operating temperatures during peak load
- 15 years of service life completed

===============================================================================
                        NEXT MAINTENANCE

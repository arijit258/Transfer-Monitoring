               PARTIAL DISCHARGE ANALYSIS - TR-005
               Epsilon Power Station Unit
               Rating: 150 MVA | Voltage: 400/132 kV
===============================================================================

STATUS: ⛔ CRITICAL - Active Partial Discharge Detected
HEALTH INDEX: 28%
RISK: Internal flashover / Complete insulation failure

===============================================================================
                    PD MEASUREMENT SUMMARY
===============================================================================

ACOUSTIC EMISSION MONITORING:
- Maximum PD Magnitude: 2400 pC (Threshold: 500 pC)
- PD Activity Level: SEVERE
- Location: HV Winding (Phase A, Turns 15-22)
- Pattern: Consistent with void discharge in paper insulation

ELECTRICAL PD MEASUREMENT:
- HFCT (High Frequency Current Transformer) Detection
- Repetitive PD pulses at 450-520 Hz
- Phase correlation: Peak activity at 45° and 225°
- Indicates: Internal void/delamination in winding insulation

===============================================================================
                    DGA CORRELATION
===============================================================================

The DGA results strongly correlate with PD activity:

1. ACETYLENE (C2H2): 35 ppm
   - Normal: <2 ppm
   - Indicates electrical discharge/arcing
   - Confirms PD is generating arc-type degradation

2. HYDROGEN (H2): 485 ppm
   - Normal: <100 ppm
   - Primary indicator of electrical fault
   - 5x above threshold

3. METHANE (CH4): 165 ppm
   - Elevated due to localized heating from PD

KEY RATIO ANALYSIS:
- C2H2/C2H4 = 0.19 → Low-energy discharge
- C2H2/H2 = 0.07 → Thermal fault with discharge
- Duval Triangle: D1 (Low-energy discharge)

===============================================================================
                    ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION
===============================================================================

PROBABLE CAUSES:
1. Insulation aging (20 years service)
2. Thermal cycling stress on winding insulation
3. Moisture absorption weakening paper
4. Manufacturing defect (void) now propagating
5. Prior overload events causing hot spot damage

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:
- High operating voltage stress (400 kV)
- Frequent load cycling
- Historical overload events
- Moisture content: 38 ppm (elevated)

===============================================================================
                    FAILURE PROGRESSION MODEL
===============================================================================

Stage 1 (2016-2018): Initial void development
Stage 2 (2019-2020): PD inception, <500 pC
Stage 3 (2021-2022): PD growth, 500-1500 pC
Stage 4 (2023-2024): Accelerating degradation, >1500 pC
Stage 5 (Current): CRITICAL - Risk of tracking/flashover

ESTIMATED TIME TO FAILURE:
- Without action: 6-18 months
- With load reduction: 18-36 months
- Probability of failure (12 months): 45%

===============================================================================
                   RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
===============================================================================

IMMEDIATE (NOW):
1. ⛔ Reduce load to 60% maximum
2. ⛔ Continuous PD monitoring
3. ⛔ Schedule emergency outage within 30 days
4. ⛔ Prepare contingency switching arrangements

DURING OUTAGE:
1. Internal inspection of HV winding
2. Detailed sweep frequency response analysis
3. Capacitance and tan delta per winding
4. Consider targeted repair or rewinding

STRATEGIC:
1. Budget for replacement: $4.5M - $6M
2. Order replacement transformer (lead time: 18 months)
3. Evaluate refurbishment vs new unit

===============================================================================
                    ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
===============================================================================

Option 1: Continue Operation (Risk-based)
- Expected failure cost: $12M - $20M
- Risk probability: 45% (12 months)
- Expected value of loss: $5.4M - $9M

Option 2: Planned Replacement
- Replacement cost: $5M
- Planned outage cost: $500K
- Total: $5.5M

Option 3: Refurbishment
- Estimated cost: $1.5M - $2M
- Extended life: 5-8 years
- Risk: Uncertain outcome

RECOMMENDATION: Plan replacement, operate at reduced load
